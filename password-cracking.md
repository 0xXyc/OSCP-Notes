# ðŸ”“ Password Cracking

## Obtaining Hash

* Do you have a certain file that is encrypted and is password locked?
* The following binaries will grab the hash of the password and convert it to a crackable hash that can be used with a wordlist such as rockyou.txt.

### Zip File

```
zip2john
```

### 7z File

```
7z2john
```

### pdf File

```
pdfcrack
```

### Doc File

```
office2john
```

### .net File

```
dnspy
```

## Hashcat

### Hash Types

{% embed url="https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes" %}

### Syntax Examples

```
hashcat -m 1000 <hash> rockyou.txt
```

## John

### Syntax Examples

```
john -=/home/usr/share/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt hash
```

## AS-REP Roasting

Requirements:

* You need a valid username
* Password is NOT required

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">impacket-GetNPUsers</mark>
2. Obtain hash
3. Crack offline with Hashcat

```
hashcat -m 18200 -a 0 hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

## Kerberoasting

Requirements:

* You need a valid username and password

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">impacket-GetUserSPNs</mark>
2. Obtain hash
3. Crack offline with Hashcat

```
hashcat -m 13100 --force hashes.txt rockyou.txt
```

## Hydra

### Bruteforcing

```
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 192.168.78.56 ftp
```

## **Online Password Crackers**

Confusingly these are also online crackers but these are collections of pre-broken hashes (e.g. wordlists that have been hashed) or computing services that you can use to break hashes.&#x20;

I usually went for these first to see if they had the hash cracked in their database. However, donâ€™t use these online crackers as your main tools for everything.&#x20;

Uploading a hash from an engagement can be a huge risk so make sure you use your offline tools to crack those types of hashes. Here is a list of online hash crackers that I found online that you can use to crack hashes:
