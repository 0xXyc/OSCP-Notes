Client side attacks are attacks in which the threat actor is attempting to gain access to the network that utilizes <mark style="color:yellow;">techniques that require a victim's user interaction</mark>.&#x20;

This includes:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Enticing them to click a link</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Open a document</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Send them to your malicious website</mark>

### Social Engineering

This is one of the most common tactics that can be used to execute proper client side attacks. Depending on the tactic you use or the information you gathered during the information gathering stage, you will have a higher chance of success for the client to click on it.
