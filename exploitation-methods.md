# ðŸ˜ˆ Exploitation Methods

## Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Vulnerability

* This is a type of access control vulnerability that can occur in web applications of other interfaces for directly accessing an object, databse, or other item.
* The vulnerability stems from the reference itself when the application <mark style="color:yellow;">does not perform a check for access control or authentication</mark>.
* It is possible that without a check or authentication that we can gain access to another user account or other important information.

### Example

* Always be sure to intercept requests with Burp
* Somewhere within the request, you will see <mark style="color:yellow;">id=x</mark>
* The number is a reference to an object
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Whenever you see id, think IDOR</mark>

### Request Example

```
#Original request
body=hello+world&return=home&user_id=5

#Modified request -- What happens when we chang the number on the end?
body=hello+world&return=home&user_id=1
```
