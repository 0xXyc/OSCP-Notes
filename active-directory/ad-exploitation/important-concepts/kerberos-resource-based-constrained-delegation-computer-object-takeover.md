# Kerberos Resource-based Constrained Delegation: Computer Object Takeover

## Overview

* You need to have Write privilege (WriteAll) on a Domain AD Object!

## Kerberos Delegation VS Resource-Based Constrained Delegation

* In unconstrained and constrained Kerberos delegation, a computer/user is told what resources it can delegate authentications to
* In resource based Kerberos delegation, computers (resources) specify who they trust and who can delegate authentications to them
