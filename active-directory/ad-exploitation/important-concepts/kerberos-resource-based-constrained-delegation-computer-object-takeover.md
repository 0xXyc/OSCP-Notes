# Kerberos Resource-based Constrained Delegation: Computer Object Takeover

## Overview

* You need to have <mark style="color:yellow;">Write privilege on a Domain AD Object</mark>
* Examples include <mark style="color:yellow;">WriteAll</mark> or <mark style="color:yellow;">GenericAll</mark>!
* This usually stems from a user as we can see in the picture below

What does that look like in BloodHound?

* We can manipulate the target however we wish
* In other words, we can create or modify properties on the machine account

## BloodHound's Abuse Info (GenericAll)

* We can <mark style="color:yellow;">create a new machine account using a tool called</mark> <mark style="color:red;">**PowerMad**</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Modify the existing DC account so that it</mark> <mark style="color:red;">trusts</mark> <mark style="color:yellow;">our new machine account</mark>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">When we have Resource-Based Constrained Delegation...</mark>

* The computers specify WHICH machines they trust delegation authentication to
* Since we can write to the DC, we can tell the DC to trust our newly created/fake account
* Once we create the fake account, we can set <mark style="color:yellow;">msDS-AllowedToActOnBehalfOfOtherIdentity</mark> field of the computer account that we are taking over&#x20;
* The DC will trust this computer account with delegation
* We then use <mark style="color:yellow;">Rubeus</mark> to <mark style="color:yellow;">impersonate the Administrator on the DC</mark>
* We need PowerView, PowerMad, and Rubeus

### However, XCT has a better way!

* Upload <mark style="color:yellow;">Rubeus</mark> and <mark style="color:yellow;">StandIn</mark>
  * StandIn is a .NET native solution to perform resource-based constrained delegation

<mark style="color:yellow;">Rubeus:</mark>

## Kerberos Delegation VS Resource-Based Constrained Delegation

* In unconstrained and constrained Kerberos delegation, a computer/user is told what resources it can delegate authentications to
* In resource based Kerberos delegation, computers (resources) specify who they trust and who can delegate authentications to them
