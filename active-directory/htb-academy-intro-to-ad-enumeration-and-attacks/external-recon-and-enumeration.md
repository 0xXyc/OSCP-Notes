## Introduction

<mark style="color:yellow;">Before performing any pentest, it can be highly beneficial to perform external reconnaissance on your target prior to the assessment. This can help you out in a multitude of ways:</mark>

* Validates information&#x20;
* Ensures that you are staying within the scope of assessment that is measured in the Rules of Engagement (RoE) document
* Look for information that is <mark style="color:yellow;">publicly accessible</mark> such as leaked credentials or usernames
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">This kind of information is extremely useful when it comes time to perform internal assessments!</mark>

### Why is this important?
