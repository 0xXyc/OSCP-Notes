# Crypto Trading Security Best Practices

## Introduction/Motivation

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Why create this guide?**</mark>

I've always loved cryptocurrency and am a firm believer of the perks and benefits that come along with it. With that being said, and like anything else awesome in life, it comes with few different inherent risks that must be faced and accepted in order to continue operation to maximize security and success to avoid losing your assets.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**The Goals?**</mark>

**I want you to walk away from this guide more interested about your operational security (OpSec) and protecting your investments as much as possible.**

#### TL;DR

<mark style="color:green;">In this guide, I am offering some additional context as to why you want to consider this route but if you are in a hurry or already aware of the reasoning, be sure to skip to the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Trading Solution**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">section to jump right into the guide!</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**In the world of cyber security, I've learned...**</mark>

**There is no such thing as a&#x20;**_**balance**_**&#x20;in terms of security over convenience in every day life.**&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Confused? Keep reading:**</mark>&#x20;

**Too much convenience and you've compromised your security posture. Too much security and you've safeguarded yourself so much to the point that working is an extreme chore and in order to be both productive and secure simultaneously is extremely difficult. Finding a healthy median is the ultimate goal. This guide attempts to take both qualities into account to make this possible.**&#x20;

**This can be perceived as a scale.**

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**What is the structure of this guide going to follow?**</mark>

Due to the complexity of this information and to avoid information overload, this guide is going to be split up into two different parts: **Segmentation** and **Abiding to Best Practices.**

## Segmentation

In order to protect your assets, you must consider (assume) all of your personal devices are already compromised and you need to take immediate action to avoid [**social engineering**](https://www.cmu.edu/iso/aware/dont-take-the-bait/social-engineering.html) (human hacking e.g. phishing, vishing, etc.) and other hacking attempts against you.&#x20;

In security terms, this effort is best known as the <mark style="color:red;">**assumed breach approach/mindset**</mark> (assuming that all information technology devices are already breached/compromised and best efforts must be taken into account to minimize damages).

Another way to look at **Segmentation** is by applying a **layered security approach** methodology to anything that is systems or information technology-related within your life. In a nutshell, this makes the life of an attacker much more difficult and ensures that one system is able to "pick up the slack" and still successfully maintain the integrity of your security if one security system/implementation fails or becomes compromised. &#x20;

Ensuring that your assets are abiding to the layered security approach will ensure that you are able to both store your assets and trade in the most secure manner as possible.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**How do I get started?**</mark>

**As you continue reading this guide, you will notice that there will be a few products that I highly recommend you purchase in order to give you a significant edge in terms of security.**&#x20;

**I would immediately begin with purchasing two products that will instantly provide a security boost to your current security posture:**

1. <mark style="color:green;">**Cryptocurrency "Cold Wallet" Asset Storage Solution**</mark>: [Nano Ledger X](https://www.amazon.com/Ledger-Nano-Cryptocurrency-Hardware-Bluetooth/dp/B07M6R4NK3?crid=2HMJ8FGL8U11B\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m3q5go0pbnWJTR1UHvEWY110NjB0sEg1L4Q3dQ-snLtZt70Wyr44sTtHVhiARCSjMP3xXUxZqBm76Tk_Db3PGBa58AIDyU7jbxdQzZMx1pL3RsQe9GgGMvVucU97zXiTIuNPl6zDcsESE6kYAY9wdfb7AjhLEFRJbyBbX5WVbt8sOb2CExgPvAtRcSe4F3DDlAEc3nYAdM_8opLm7vw_y1KzfTNjkVbfa_zisbowhIo.aE6UsS8rvl6t2lLHQMMZpM7_qK0X2nc5MwDceYzSAts\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=nano+ledger+zero\&qid=1735824223\&sprefix=nano+ledger+zero%2Caps%2C126\&sr=8-4)
2. <mark style="color:green;">**Faraday Bag**</mark>**:** [**SLNT**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CRNSZ3G?_encoding=UTF8\&th=1)&#x20;

**Not familiar with these products? Don't worry, I'll be giving a brief description of them and why they are so important and should be added to your everyday carry (EDC).**

## Trading Solution

<mark style="color:green;">The convenience of being able to trade on your phone is great, but being able to trade on your laptop is just as convenient and it offers enhanced security solutions such as virtual machines (VM's).</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">This is essentially a segmented, more secure environment for you to conduct your daily activities in. Whether you are on a Mac or a Windows laptop or PC, you will be able to utilize this technology following these techniques.</mark>&#x20;

### Setting up our new Virtual Environment

1. Download VMware Fusion if you are on a Mac or [WMware Workstation Pro 17](https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html) in order to obtain virtualization software to create your VM
   1. 💡It is going to ask you to create a Broadcom account, go ahead and fill this with alias and fake information
2. Now that you have virtualization software, you will now need an operating system (OS) that is able to virtualize an entire OS within your host computer's virtual address space (memory, or Random Access Memory (RAM) within your computer)
   1. For this use case, I recommend the usage of Ubuntu
   2. Ubuntu is an open-source, Linux-based distribution/OS that is easy to learn and can be quickly spun up on virtually any computer/architecture&#x20;
   3. You can grab your copy [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ubuntu-22.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso) for x86/64 processors (<mark style="color:yellow;">most of you will download this one</mark>) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description\&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWVhLURlbmFCcmhTSEtTRDFNM25nd1Yyb3FqQXxBQ3Jtc0trdVMxVi15NFNsMnoxSVh2b09TRDNoRXppSm5Da1Z4aGU4dFVvc3JlVlBYeGxVa2h0cXlLMUxXenAxckFyRUFpeHpRdjlrWVNvcl90UU5sc0ZXemthVkN1LXBPc1M5Wm1nY3NCNUo3SFV5NEhXbFYxNA\&q=https%3A%2F%2Fcdimage.ubuntu.com%2Fjammy%2Fdaily-live%2Fcurrent%2F\&v=b8W2-zjzOK0) if you are on an ARM-based Mac (Apple Silicon — newer Macs)

Once you have installed the following software, I then want you to begin be installing the VMware software first. Once opened, you will then navigate to the **New** tab and from there, you will be able to navigate through your **Downloads** folder to find your Ubuntu image that you have downloaded.

> &#x20;_<mark style="color:yellow;">**🚨 Be sure to adjust your CPU and memory count to above the default values. For most, the sweet spot will be around 4 CPU's and 8GB of memory. This is crucial to having a stable, reliable, and speedy virtualized system. Also, for this purpose, 50GB of storage space is plenty for this type of application for the VM.**</mark>_

**Once you are past this part, you will then install the Ubuntu OS like you would on a normal computer. It will appear that you are deleting everything within your storage space and this is true to a degree, this only applies to your 50 GB of allocated space within the virtual address space you assigned to the virtual disk upon creation of the VM. Not to your host OS (Mac or Windows).**&#x20;

> <mark style="color:yellow;">**🤔 If you are confused at this part, please reach out to me and I will gladly help you with this step. You will only need to do this once after it is successfully installed and configured.**</mark>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (232).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Illustration of installing Telegram easily on Ubuntu</p></figcaption></figure>

Now that we have Telegram installed, we can launch it by pressing the applications button on the bottom-left of the screen in Ubuntu and we can search for "Telegram".&#x20;

Next, we can follow the on-screen instructions that will allow us scan a QR code with our cell phone that will allow the same session as our cell phone's to be authenticated to our newly created desktop client. Message syncing and contacts will be synced from device-to-device.&#x20;

> <mark style="color:green;">💡 Here, we can trade crypto utilizing well-vetted trading bots and sync our wallets accordingly using best practices in a safe and sterile environment that is virtually segmented from your other data and assets.</mark> &#x20;

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (235).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example image</p></figcaption></figure>

The above is showcasing the usage of an Ethereum trading bot known as Starbot. With this, I can create a wallet address and transfer stored crypto from my cold wallet storage device such as the Nano Ledger X to our volatile trading account (wallet) for bot usage.&#x20;

> <mark style="color:red;">**‼️ Pro tip:**</mark> The Nano Ledger X cold wallet storage device should be treated like a savings account and should essentially never be touched. Whereas your bot trading account/wallet should never store excessive amounts of crypto for security reasons as you do not have control of the entire key pair (private and public keys). The bot developers will always have access to your private keys likely even if they say that they do not.
