# Crypto Trading Security Best Practices

## Introduction/Motivation

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Why create this guide?**</mark>

I've always loved cryptocurrency and am a firm believer of the perks and benefits that come along with it. With that being said, and like anything else awesome in life, it comes with few different inherent risks that must be faced and accepted in order to continue operation to maximize security and success to avoid losing your assets.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**The Goals?**</mark>

**I want you to walk away from this guide more interested about your operational security (OpSec) and protecting your investments as much as possible.**

<mark style="color:yellow;">**In the world of cyber security, I've learned...**</mark>

**There is no such thing as a&#x20;**_**balance**_**&#x20;in terms of security over convenience in every day life.**&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Confused? Keep reading:**</mark>&#x20;

**Too much convenience and you've compromised your security posture. Too much security and you've safeguarded yourself so much to the point that working is an extreme chore and in order to be both productive and secure simultaneously is extremely difficult. Finding a healthy median is the ultimate goal. This guide attempts to take both qualities into account to make this possible.**&#x20;

**This can be perceived as a scale.**

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**What is the structure of this guide going to follow?**</mark>

Due to the complexity of this information and to avoid information overload, this guide is going to be split up into two different parts: **Segmentation** and **Abiding to Best Practices.**

## Segmentation

In order to protect your assets, you must consider (assume) all of your personal devices are already compromised and you need to take immediate action to avoid [**social engineering**](https://www.cmu.edu/iso/aware/dont-take-the-bait/social-engineering.html) (human hacking e.g. phishing, vishing, etc.) and other hacking attempts against you.&#x20;

In security terms, this effort is best known as the <mark style="color:red;">**assumed breach approach/mindset**</mark> (assuming that all information technology devices are already breached/compromised and best efforts must be taken into account to minimize damages).

Another way to look at **Segmentation** is by applying a **layered security approach** methodology to anything that is systems or information technology-related within your life. In a nutshell, this makes the life of an attacker much more difficult and ensures that one system is able to "pick up the slack" and still successfully maintain the integrity of your security if one security system/implementation fails or becomes compromised. &#x20;

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**How do I get started?**</mark>

**As you continue reading this guide, you will notice that there will be a few products that I highly recommend you purchase in order to give you a significant edge in terms of security.**&#x20;

**I would immediately begin with purchasing two products that will instantly provide a security boost to your current security posture:**

1. <mark style="color:green;">**Cryptocurrency "Cold Wallet" Asset Storage Solution**</mark>: [Nano Ledger X](https://www.amazon.com/Ledger-Nano-Cryptocurrency-Hardware-Bluetooth/dp/B07M6R4NK3?crid=2HMJ8FGL8U11B\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m3q5go0pbnWJTR1UHvEWY110NjB0sEg1L4Q3dQ-snLtZt70Wyr44sTtHVhiARCSjMP3xXUxZqBm76Tk_Db3PGBa58AIDyU7jbxdQzZMx1pL3RsQe9GgGMvVucU97zXiTIuNPl6zDcsESE6kYAY9wdfb7AjhLEFRJbyBbX5WVbt8sOb2CExgPvAtRcSe4F3DDlAEc3nYAdM_8opLm7vw_y1KzfTNjkVbfa_zisbowhIo.aE6UsS8rvl6t2lLHQMMZpM7_qK0X2nc5MwDceYzSAts\&dib_tag=se\&keywords=nano+ledger+zero\&qid=1735824223\&sprefix=nano+ledger+zero%2Caps%2C126\&sr=8-4)
