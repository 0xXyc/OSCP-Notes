## Android Ecosystem

The Android ecosystem is extremely fragmented in a multitude of ways. Mainly due to a wide variety of form factors, different operating system flavors (Linux-based), and manufacturers.&#x20;

With over three billion Android devices operational in the entire world, making up 71% of the global mobile operating system market share, understanding Android security in the world of cyber security has become unbelievably important. As a result, having a foundational knowledge base of vulnerability classes and exploitation in this area has become more paramount than ever.&#x20;
