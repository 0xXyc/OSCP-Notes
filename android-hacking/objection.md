# Objection

## Installation

Note: If you are having problems, uninstall objection using pipx and pip3. There is a good chance that you have a conflicting dependancy.

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">`pip3 install objection`</mark>
2. <mark style="color:yellow;">`echo $PATH`</mark>
3. <mark style="color:yellow;">`export PATH=/Users/user-name/Library/Python/3.x/bin`</mark>
   1. This was obtained from the warning after using pip3
4. Now run <mark style="color:yellow;">`objection`</mark>
