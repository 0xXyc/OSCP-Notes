# FridaLab (Learning Frida)

## Introduction

Lately, I've been involved in efforts that require heavy usage of Frida. In this writeup, I'm going to be covering the walkthrough for FridaLab which is a vulnerable APK that you can practice your Frida skills on and can be found [here](https://rossmarks.uk/blog/fridalab/).

I highly recommend checking out Dark Wolf Solutions Android Security Research Playbook ([ASRP](https://github.com/DarkWolf-Labs/playbooks/blob/main/Android-Security-Research-Playbook.pdf)) for a reference guide for performing Android security research.&#x20;
