# üìç SSL Certificate Pinning

## What is Certpinning?

<mark style="color:yellow;">Certificate pinning is a security technique that was originally devised as a means to mitigate Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks.</mark> The application accepts only authorized or "pinned" certificates for authentication of client-server connections.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Any attempted secure connection requests utilizing non-pinned certificates are refused.</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">This technique is usually only found in very expensive, lucrative applications or other pieces of technology because of how expensive it is to implement this technique.</mark>&#x20;

## How does it work?

<mark style="color:yellow;">The idea is actually very simple; it is accomplished by correlating a host, from which connections will be sent, with the predetermined certificate.</mark>

Once the association has been established between the host and the certificate, the relationship is formed, and the certificate has been pinned to the host.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Pinning adds an extra layer of security by making it more difficult for a would-be attacker to compromise a pin by placing themselves in the middle of the communication (hence Man-in-The-Middle).</mark> This can be especially important during the early development phase. The pinning process can also take place once an application first attempts to connect. This is known as "key continuity".

## Common Mistakes Made by Developers During Development

<mark style="color:yellow;">Application developers are free to choose what certificate chain is pinned.</mark>

At minimum, one certificate in the chain of trust should be controlled solely by the organization that owns the application. <mark style="color:yellow;">However, an often repeated mistake is to only pin the root certificate in a chain.</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">Why is this so bad?</mark> This over-simplification of the process will leave a vulnerability in which a malicious adversary can gain access by leveraging a certificate obtained from the same Certificate Authority (CA).

## Security Recommendations

Developers should HIGHLY consider adding more than one or all certificates in the chain including:

#### <mark style="color:green;">Root Certificates</mark>

A root certificate is issued by a trusted CA based on a defined certificate validation method with public/private key pairing. It is very carefully monitored and protected by the root CA that issues them.

#### <mark style="color:green;">Intermediate Certificates</mark>

Intermediate certificates serves as an intermediary between the leaf and root certificates. While there must be at least one intermediate cert in a chain, it is also possible to deploy multiple intermediates within a single chain.&#x20;

It is possible to perform pinning with only the intermediate certificates but it is not recommended because you place all of your trust in the intermediate CA.

#### <mark style="color:green;">Leaf Certificates</mark>

Leaf certificates are the highest-level certificate in a chain. The pinning of a leaf certificate assures a certificate match. These are also known as end-user or end-entity certificates.

## Problems with Certpinning

* Resolution of compromised keys
* Very expensive to maintain
* Lack of cryptographic agility; cryptographic changes happen way more often than we think. Since this is another issue, it complicates everything further
* We also will see how if you own the device/target you are attacking, the certpinning defense can almost ALWAYS be bypassed with Frida!
