Automating Assetfinder:

<mark style="color:yellow;">assets.sh</mark>

```
#!/bin/bash

url=$1

if [ ! -d "$url" ];then
    mkdir $url
fi

if [ ! -d "$url/recon" ];then
    mkdir $url/recon
fi

echo "[+] Harvesting subdomains with Assetfinder..."
assetfinder $url >> $url/recon/assets.txt
cat $url/recon/assets.txt | grep $1 >> $url/recon/final.txt
rm $url/recon/assets.txt

#echo "[+] Harvesting subdomains with Amass..."
#amass enum -d $url >> $url/recon/f.txt
#sort -u $url/recon/f.txt >> $url/recon/final.txt
#rm $url/recon/f.txt

echo "[+] Probing for alive domains..."
cat $url/recon/final.txt | sort -u | httprobe -s -p https:443 | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443' >> $url/recon/alive.txt
```

Dry run:

```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh tesla.com
cd tesla.com/recon
cat final.txt
```

```
./run.sh tesla.com
```

* Open alive.txt!

```
cat tesla.com/recon/alive.txt | grep dev
cat tesla.com/recon/alive.txt | grep test
cat tesla.com/recon/alive.txt | grep stag
cat tesla.com/recon/alive.txt | grep admin
```

## Finding Subdomains w/ Amass

{% embed url="https://github.com/OWASP/Amass" %}
Repo
{% endembed %}

```
amass enum -d tesla.com
```

## HTTProbe

{% embed url="https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe.git" %}
Repo
{% endembed %}

Installing:

```
go get -u github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe
```

Find out if the hosts are alive or not:

```
cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt

cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe

cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s -p https:443
```

Strip off the http or https:

```
cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s -p https:443 | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443'
```
