# Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads

## Non-Staged

* Sends exploit shellcode all at once
* Larger in size and won't always work

Example:&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">windows/meterpreter\_reverse\_tcp</mark>

## Staged

* Sends payload in stages
* Can be less stable

Example:&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">windows/meterpreter/reverse\_tcp</mark>
