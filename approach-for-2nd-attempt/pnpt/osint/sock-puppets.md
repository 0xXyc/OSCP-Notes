# Sock Puppets

## Introduction

* Online identity/misrepresentation of who you are
* Do not draw attention back to yourself
* Never let that person know that you are into them
* This person should never tie back to your IP address, phone that is tied to you, address, or anything else!

## Creating Sock Puppets

* Since a sock puppet is a misrepresentation of you, you may want to consider something such as representing yourself as a woman instead of a man
* Some of the world's best social engineers are women
* Men are more susceptible to social engineering attacks when women are involved
*
