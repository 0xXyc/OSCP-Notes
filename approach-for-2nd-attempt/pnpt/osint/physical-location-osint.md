# Physical Location OSINT

We can utilize things such as satellite imagery to perform reconnaissance of the location you are performing the test on.

* We can do this with Google Earth
* Think of what can we attack?
* Look for "smoke break" areas or other common hangout places for employees

Tips:

* Be sure to utilize the street view option
* Look for windows and doors of interest
* Is there a guarded entrance?
* Identify dress code of employees
* Are there badge readers near doors?
