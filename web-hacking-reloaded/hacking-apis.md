# Hacking API's

## Hacking Application Programming Interfaces!!

Wow, just in time for the spooky season, let's dive right into this one!

Notably, I am going to be using some personal experience as well as a few references throughout the writing of this blog post. I hope you enjoy!!

## Introduction

In many assessments, your client or target is going to have some sort of way to process information between their web apps and in a standardized way where it is understood what to do with that data.

## Swagger API Documentation

Coming soon.
