# Unstoppable

## Mission

There's a lending pool with a million DVT tokens in balance, offering flash loans for free.

If only there was a way to <mark style="color:yellow;">attack and stop the pool from offering flash loans</mark> ...

"You start with 100 DVT tokens in balance."

* The goal is to stop the pool from offering flash loans
* Essentially a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
