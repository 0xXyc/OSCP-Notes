* Be sure you have a valid transaction hash (trxn or tx hash)
* Specify your network that you are operating on
  * Ethereum Goerli Testnet
  * Ethereum Mainnet
* Select "<mark style="color:yellow;">Decode now</mark>"

## Example

* IoC Address: <mark style="color:red;">`0x02446fb530b6910eeb393d46bc62ab36ddca2c8028366c87507ff3091172d6d1`</mark>

* Follow the trail all the way through
* Make notes of anything that appears out of the ordinary
* Make high-level notes with lots of subsection information in between
* Research, research, and more research
