# ðŸ“‚ 2049/NFS

## Enumeration

* Open NFSâ€™s work by utilizing read/write access permissions.
  * Read Access: Possible confidential file is available
  * Write Access: Possible file upload to execute through web service

### Useful Nmap Scripts <a href="#useful-nmap-scripts" id="useful-nmap-scripts"></a>

```
nfs-ls #List NFS exports and check permissions
nfs-showmount #Like showmount -e
nfs-statfs #Disk statistics and info from NFS share
```

## Mounting

To know **which folder** has the server **available** to mount you an ask it using:

```
showmount -e <IP>
```

Then mount it using:

```
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] <ip>:<remote_folder> <local_folder> -o nolock
```

You should specify to **use version 2** because it doesn't have **any** **authentication** or **authorization**.

**Example:**

**Enumerate share:**

```
showmount -e 10.10.10.10
Export list for 10.10.10.10:
/site_backups (everyone)
```

Create directory for mount point:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/HTB_Site_Backups
```

Mount the share to newly created mount point:

```
sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.10.10:/site_backups /mnt/HTB_Site_Backups/ -o nolock
```

## Tools:

Mount: For mounting share availability

Showmount: For finding shares available
