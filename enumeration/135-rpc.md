# ⌨ 135/RPC

## How can we take advantage of this?

* This can allow you to identify exposed RPC services and allow you to find additional enumeration routes or vulnerabilities linked to the system.

## rpcdump:

```python
D:\\rpctools> rpcdump [-p port] 192.168.189.1
IfId: 5a7b91f8-ff00-11d0-a9b2-00c04fb6e6fc version 1.0
Annotation: Messenger Service
UUID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Binding: ncadg_ip_udp:192.168.189.1[1028]
```

* You can now Google the UUID for a vulnerability or known service that will aid you in enumeration.

## Notable RPC Interfaces:

```python
IFID value
Named pipe
Description
12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ab
\\pipe\\lsarpc
LSA interface, used to enumerate users

3919286a-b10c-11d0-9ba8-00c04fd92ef5
\\pipe\\lsarpc
LSA Directory Services (DS) interface, used to enumerate domains and trust relationships

12345778-1234-abcd-ef00-0123456789ac
\\pipe\\samr
LSA SAMR interface, used to access public SAM database elements (e.g., usernames) and brute-force user passwords regardless of account lockout policy 

1ff70682-0a51-30e8-076d-740be8cee98b
\\pipe\\atsvc
Task scheduler, used to remotely execute commands

338cd001-2244-31f1-aaaa-900038001003
\\pipe\\winreg
Remote registry service, used to access the system registry

367abb81-9844-35f1-ad32-98f038001003
\\pipe\\svcctl
Service control manager and server services, used to remotely start and stop services and execute commands

4b324fc8-1670-01d3-1278-5a47bf6ee188
\\pipe\\srvsvc
Service control manager and server services, used to remotely start and stop services and execute commands

4d9f4ab8-7d1c-11cf-861e-0020af6e7c57
\\pipe\\epmapper
DCOM interface, supporting WMI
```

*   NOTE:

    * Remember the APT box when we had to utilize IOXIDRESOLVER to enumerate IPv6 interface information? This then led to a vast increase in overall box attack surface? Well, the same methodology applies here.

* Username enumeration

## rpcclient

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python">rpcclient -U ‘%’ -N &#x3C;IP>

rpcclient -U "" -N [ip]

Have valid credentials? Use them to connect:
rpcclient -U &#x3C;user> 10.10.10.193

To enumerate printers:
enumprinters

To enumerate users and groups:
enumdomusers
enumdomgroups

The above command will output user/group RIDs. You can pass those into further queries like:
querygroup &#x3C;RID>
querygroupmem &#x3C;RID>
queryuser &#x3C;RID>

<strong>Get information on a particular user:
</strong><strong>queryuser 0x1f4
</strong>

Get less information about all users:
querydispinfo

</code></pre>

## Enum4Linux

```
enum4linux -a [IP]
```

## Tool:

rpcclient

rpcdump
