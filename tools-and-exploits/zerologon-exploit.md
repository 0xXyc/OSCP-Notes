# ZeroLogon Exploit

## CVE-2020-1472 (A.K.A. ZeroLogon)

### "Instantly become Domain Admin by subverting Netlogon Cryptography"

This exploit stems from a <mark style="color:yellow;">vulnerability</mark> in the <mark style="color:yellow;">Netlogon Remote Protocol</mark>

* This exploit stems from <mark style="color:yellow;">cryptographic authentication flaws</mark>
* This is a pretty nasty vulnerability
* This will allow an attacker to impersonate any computer (such as the domain controller)
* You will be able to delete the hash/password from the user and authenticate without a password
* The attacker must have a foothold within your network and a connection to the Domain Controller must be possible

## Technical Details

How does it work exactly?

* The attacker must forge an authentication token for specific Netlogon functionality
* Call a function to establish the computer password of the Domain Controller to a known value
* Once this is done, the attacker can use this new password to take control over the DC and steal credentials of a Domain Admin
* Once achieved, the attacker can execute RPC's to all workstations across the Domain
