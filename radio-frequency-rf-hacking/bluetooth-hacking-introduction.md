# Bluetooth Hacking Introduction

## Introduction

Bluetooth is a short range wireless protocol.

The frequency operates on the <mark style="color:yellow;">2.4 GHz</mark> spectrum.

This is the same as Wi-Fi and microwaves! Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).

Low power consumption protocol. Consumes low amounts of power through incremental bursts of received data and broadcasted data.&#x20;

It is widely support on mobile platforms, computers, IoT devices, and more.&#x20;

## Protocols

Classic (Basic Rate)

Low Energy (LE or BLE)

### Bluetooth Classic

Higher-power consumption protocol and can max our at 3Mbps and fluctuates around 1Mbps/2Mbps/3Mbps. Faster than BLE.

Pairing your phone with your car = Bluetooth Classic

80 channels.

Other examples: audio streaming (Bluetooth speaker) and data transfer

### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

Lower-power consumption

125Kbps/500Kbps/1Mbps/2Mbps

40 Channels: 3 advertising/37 data

Examples: Data transfer, location services, device networks, audio streaming (future innovation incoming).

(To be continued...)
