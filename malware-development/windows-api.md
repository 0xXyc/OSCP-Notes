# Windows API

This API is utilized to DIRECTLY interface with Windows. It is an interface that is available strictly within Windows.

### Windows MessageBox function (winuser.h, windows.h)

Want a message box in your application? Look no further.

Simply call `MessageBox()` and give it the int data type and that's it!

```c
int MessageBox()
```

This is pretty much the "Hello world" introduction to the Windows API!

What would this look like?

```c
#include <windows.h>

int main(void)
{

    MessageBoxW(Null, L"This is a message box!", L"Hello WORLD!!!!", MB_YESNOCANCEL);
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
