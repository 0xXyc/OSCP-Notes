# Multithreading

## Introduction

A thread is a single sequence stream within a process.

Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes called lightweight processes.&#x20;

## Why use it?

Threads are a super popular way to improve applications through parallelism.&#x20;

Threads operate much faster than processes due to the following:

* Thread creation is much faster
* Context switching between threads is much faster
* Threads can be terminated very easily
* Communication between threads is faster

## to-do

Research multi threading and concurrency!
