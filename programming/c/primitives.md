# Primitives // Data Types

## Types

Fundamental to any program. <mark style="color:yellow;">Types tell us what our data means and what kind of operations we can perform on them</mark>.&#x20;

## Primitives

This is classified as the <mark style="color:yellow;">smallest possible data type</mark>.&#x20;

This is not by size, but by the fact that they cannot be broken down into pieces.&#x20;

* A better word would be indivisible

## Complex - struct

Using a <mark style="color:yellow;">primitive data type to make something more complex</mark>.

Note: it is possible to combine multiple structs to make even bigger structures

The reason you would do this is because of very complex data structures.

#### Example 1

**Explanation:** The variable `today` is of data type `Date`.

```c
Date today;
```

#### Example 2

**Explanation:** The variable `lol` is of data type `coordinates`.

```c
coordinates lol;
```

## Linked List

<mark style="color:yellow;">A linked list is a chain of things</mark>. This can be whatever you want to be.&#x20;

For example, you could make a linked list of `coordinates`.

You have to build this data type yourself.

#### Example

```
```

## Arrays

<mark style="color:yellow;">An array allows you to store one or more things inside of a group</mark>.&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">You can name it whatever you want</mark>.

It is stored in <mark style="color:yellow;">square brackets</mark> `[]`.

#### Example 1

```c
int grades[10];
```

|    |    |    |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1  | 2  | 3  |
| 4  | 5  | 6  |
| 12 | 20 | 44 |
| 11 |    |    |

#### Example 2

```c
char balloons[3];
```

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 'A' | 'B' | 'C' |
