# Primitives // Data Types

## Types

Fundamental to any program. <mark style="color:yellow;">Types tell us what our data means and what kind of operations we can perform on them</mark>.&#x20;

## Primitives

This is classified as the <mark style="color:yellow;">smallest possible data type</mark>.&#x20;

This is not by size, but by the fact that they cannot be broken down into pieces.&#x20;

* A better word would be indivisible

## Complex - struct

Using a <mark style="color:yellow;">primitive data type to make something more complex</mark>.

Note: it is possible to combine multiple structs to make even bigger structures

The reason you would do this is because of very complex data structures.

#### Example 1

**Explanation:** The variable `today` is of data type `Date`.

```
Date today;
```

#### Example 2

**Explanation:** The variable `lol` is of data type `coordinates`.

```
coordinates lol;
```

## Linked List

<mark style="color:yellow;">A linked list is a chain of things</mark>. This can be whatever you want to be.&#x20;

For example, you could make a linked list of `coordinates`.

You have to build this data type yourself.
