## Containerizing an Application

* In order to build the container image, you will need to use a Dockerfile
* A Dockerfile is simply a text-based file with no file extension that contains a script of instructions
* Docker will then use this script to build a container image

### Tutorial

Change into the directory with the application.

```
cd /path/to/app
```

Create an empty file named `Dockerfile`.

```
touch Dockerfile
```
