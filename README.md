## Introduction

**Hello and welcome to my security blog! I'm currently a **<mark style="color:yellow;">**Cyber Security Engineer**</mark>** and considerably involved in **<mark style="color:yellow;">**Vulnerability Research**</mark>**.**&#x20;

**This is the main place I will be documenting hacking, my notes, my methodology, and experiences**.

> "_**You must have confidence in your competence.**_"
>
> \~ Professor Russell

## Motivation

**These notes are an excellent way for me to convey my knowledge, skill set, and a good way to share what I've learned through my experiences. I believe sharing my notes is a great way to give back to others since I would not be where I am without collaboration efforts from others**.

## What am I currently working on?

## Career Choices

> I wanted to give a special thank you to Mr. Eltringham for always believing in me during my college experience. I could not have done it without you. I will forever keep your words of motivation and wisdom in the background with each professional decision I make going forward.

Within the last year, I made a switch from <mark style="color:yellow;">**Pentesting**</mark> to <mark style="color:yellow;">**Vulnerability Research**</mark> and couldn't be happier!&#x20;

**How would I compare the two?**

> I went from attacking computers from the view of a satellite to attacking them from the perspective of looking under an electron microscope.

A solid explanation of **vulnerability research**: "We're the weapon that no one saw coming :wink:".

### Projects

<mark style="color:yellow;">As of lately</mark>, I am strengthening my C and Python development skills to become a more competent developer. Want to keep track of my maldev progress -- check out my GitHub repo and my [Malware Development](malware-development/) page in my Gitbook!&#x20;

**Here I will be covering a bunch of binary exploitation:**
