Great knowledge should be free.

## Introduction

**Hello and welcome to my security blog! I'm currently a **<mark style="color:yellow;">**Cyber Security Engineer**</mark>** and considerably involved in **<mark style="color:yellow;">**Vulnerability Research**</mark>**.**&#x20;

**This is the main place I will be documenting hacking, my notes, my methodology, and experiences**.

> "_**You must have confidence in your competence.**_"
>
> \~ Professor Russell

## Motivation

**These notes are an excellent way for me to convey my knowledge, skill set, and a good way to share what I've learned through my experiences. I believe sharing my notes is a great way to give back to others since I would not be where I am without collaboration efforts from others**.

## What am I currently working on?

## Career Choices

> _**I wanted to give a special thank you to Mr. Eltringham for always believing in me during my college experience. I could not have done it without you. I will forever keep your words of motivation and wisdom in the background with each professional decision I make going forward.**_

> _**I went from attacking computers from the view of a satellite to attacking them from the perspective of looking under an electron microscope.**_
