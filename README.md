## Motivation

These notes are an excellent way for me to convey my knowledge, skill set, and a good way to share what I've learned through my experiences. I believe sharing my notes is a great way to give back to others since I would not be where I am without collaboration efforts from others.

## What am I currently working on?

### Career Choices

Within the last year, I made a switch from **pentesting** to **vulnerability research** and couldn't be happier!

### Projects

<mark style="color:yellow;">As of lately</mark>, I am strengthening my C and Python development skills to become a more competent developer. Want to keep track of my maldev progress -- check out my GitHub repo and my [Malware Development](malware-development/) page in my Gitbook!&#x20;

Another important project I have going on is from [Exploit Education](https://exploit.education/)!&#x20;

Here I will be covering a bunch of binary exploitation:
