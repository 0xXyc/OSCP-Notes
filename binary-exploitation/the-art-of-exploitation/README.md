# ðŸŽ¨ The Art of Exploitation

## High vs Low-Level Programming Languages

## Programming

* A computer does not understand English
* It only understands <mark style="color:yellow;">machine code</mark>
  * Consisting of raw bits and bytes
  * Differs from architecture to architecture

### How do you get around writing machine code?

* Writing machine language sounds absolutely terrifying (and boring)
* The work around for this is a translator
* Also known as an <mark style="color:yellow;">assembler</mark>
* Translates <mark style="color:yellow;">assembly</mark> code into machine code
* However, assembly is still an incredibly difficult to understand and work with language as it is very low-level
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Now to get around writing assembly, you need to master a higher-level programming language as they are much more intuitive</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">High-level programming languages</mark> can be <mark style="color:yellow;">translated into machine code</mark> by using a <mark style="color:yellow;">compiler</mark>

## Pseudo-Code

* This is a form of programming language called pseudo-code
* Very similar to a high-level programming language
* It is <mark style="color:yellow;">NOT understood by computers, compilers, or assemblers of any kind</mark>
* Great way for a programmer to <mark style="color:yellow;">arrange instructions</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">With that said, it makes an excellent introduction to common universal programming languages!</mark>

## Control Structures

Without control structures, a program would be a series of instructions that are executed in sequential order. This is fine for simple programs, but not good for <mark style="color:yellow;">complex ones</mark>.

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Control structures change a program's execution from a simple sequential order to a more complex and useful flow</mark>

#### Some examples of control structures are as follows:

* If-Then-Else
* While/Until Loops
* For loops

### If-Then-Else

* A special set of instructions that needs to be followed in the case of a special or uniquely occurring situation

Pseudo-Code Example in C Syntax:

```c
if (condition) then
{
    set of instructinos to execute if the condition is met;
}
else
{
    set of instructions to execute if the condition is NOT met;
}
```

Realistic Example:

```
drive down main street;
if (street is blocked)
{
    turn right on 15th street;
    turn left on pine street;
    turn right on 16th street;
}
else
{
    turn right on 16th street;
}
```

### While/Until

* This is a type of loop
* Used when a programmer wants to execute a set of instructions more than once
* You can accomplish this task by looping but it requires conditions and logic to tell the program when to stop looping&#x20;
  * Unless, you want it to continue infinitely of course
* A <mark style="color:yellow;">while loop</mark> says to <mark style="color:yellow;">execute something while a condition is true</mark>

Example:

```c
while (you are hungry)
{
    find some food;
    eat some food;
}
```

Another <mark style="color:yellow;">variation of the while loop</mark> is the <mark style="color:yellow;">until loop</mark>

* Commonly found in the Perl programming language

Example:

```perl
until (you are hungry)
{
    find some food;
    eat some food;
}
```

### For Loops

* This is a loop for a programmer that wants to loop for a certain number of iterations
  * Do something this many times
* An example would be drive straight for 5 miles
* In reality, a loop is just a while loop with a counter&#x20;
