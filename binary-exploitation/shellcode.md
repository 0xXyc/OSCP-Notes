# üêö Shellcode

## Introduction

<mark style="color:yellow;">Shellcode is a set of instructions that are injected by the user and executed by the binary</mark>.

It is usually within the "payload" of our exploit code.

Essentially, shellcode can allow us, attackers, to implement and execute code that never existed in the original binary.

#### How can I make shellcode?

* C
* Python
* x86 Assembly
* Hex strings

### How does it work?

Upon analyzing shellcode, you will come to notice that shellcodes utilize system calls, or syscalls.

#### What are syscalls?

<mark style="color:yellow;">These provide a way of requesting services from the kernel</mark>.

It allows a program to be able to interact with the underlying operating system the binary is existent on.

They are a way of communicating directly with the kernel and are the only entry point to the OS's kernel.

#### What can they do?

Syscalls exist in two primary forms, <mark style="color:yellow;">process control</mark> and <mark style="color:yellow;">file management</mark>.

We can end, terminate, create, allocate, and free memory with process control syscalls.

We can create, open, close, delete, and read files with file management syscalls.

## Shellcode Development

By following this methodology, we can create our own shellcode!

Create shellcode in Assembly, hexdump (`objdump`/carve out with `grep`/`sed`), and convert our shellcode into a hex string. So, opcodes -> hexstring.
