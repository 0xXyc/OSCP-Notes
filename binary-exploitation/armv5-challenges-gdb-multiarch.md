# ARMv5 Challenges -- gdb-multiarch

## Installation

* We can install qemu to backwards-compatible our binaries and allow us to load up the necessary tools and scripts to be able to analyze them

This setup is very simple and involves installing 2 packages and creating a symlink:

```
sudo apt install qemu-user
sudo apt install libc6-armel-cross
sudo mkdir /etc/qemu-binfmt
sudo ln -s /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi /etc/qemu-binfmt/arm
```

## Debugging ARMv5 Challenges

```
sudo apt install gdb-multiarch
pwn debug --exec <path_to_challenge_binary>
```
