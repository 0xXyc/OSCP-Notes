# ⛓️ ARM64 Return Oriented Programming (ROP)

## Introduction

I wanted a challenge, asked for it, and I received it.&#x20;

Here, I want to begin a personal, ambitious, research effort that will allow me to obtain a deeper knowledge in C, ROP/JOP, Assembly, ARM, and ARM exploitation as a whole.

My goal is to obtain an intuitive understanding of these technologies and techniques.&#x20;

**This is going to be a list of everything that I am using to drive this research effort. Unfortunately, ARM64 exploitation is still rather new compared to it's predecessor, x86/64 and there is not many resources out there. Hopefully this blog post will help out many people one day and convince them that this is a solid route to pursue.**
