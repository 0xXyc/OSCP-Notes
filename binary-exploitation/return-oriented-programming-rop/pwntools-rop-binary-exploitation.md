# pwntools ROP Binary Exploitation

## Introduction

Here, we will be learning how to use `pwntools` to aid in our exploit development for <mark style="color:yellow;">Return-Oriented-Programming</mark> (<mark style="color:yellow;">ROP</mark>) for attacking binaries.

## Startup

When starting, we want to see at what exact point we are segfaulting.

* Where does the segfault occur?
* What is the value of our instruction pointer (`EIP`/`RIP`)?
* Did we overwrite `EIP`/`RIP`?

### Techniques

#### Checking where the segfault occurred:

```
dmesg
```

#### Does the program require an argument?

```
./binary "$(python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'A'*100)")"
```

<mark style="color:yellow;">By changing the 100, we can change the amount of A's we are sending to the program as an argument to fuzz for the segfault or buffer overflow</mark>.

<mark style="color:yellow;">We will know that we are successful as soon as we see</mark> "<mark style="color:red;">Segmentation fault</mark>" being reflected to us in our output.

#### Program does not require an argument?

```
python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'A'*100)" | ./binary
```
