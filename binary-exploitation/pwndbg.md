# pwndbg

## Installation

```
cd ~/Desktop/Tools/
git clone https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg
cd pwndbg
./setup.sh
```

## Defining Alias

```
alias pwndbg="gdb -q -x ~/pwndbg/gdbinit.py"
```

## Problems?

I kept getting errors pertaining to conflicting dependencies. The fix was simply:

```
nano ~./gdbinit.py
```

* Delete everything in here and replace with the explicit location of where pwndbg's `gdbinit.py` is
* Then, you can run `gdb` normally and it will automatically invoke `pwndbg`
