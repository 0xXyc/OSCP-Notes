# No Execute (NX)

#### NX (No-Execute):

Also known as Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

This helps protect against malicious shellcode.

It focuses on making areas of the program as not executable. Your data will be stored as data and any attempt to run it as instructions will crash the program through segmentation fault and eliminate your shellcode.&#x20;
