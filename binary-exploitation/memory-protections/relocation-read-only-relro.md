# Relocation Read-Only (RELRO)

**Partial RELRO** (enabled with `-Wl,-z,relro`):

* Maps the `.got` section as read-only (but _not_ `.got.plt`)
* Rearranges sections to reduce the likelihood of global variables overflowing into control structures.

**Full RELRO** (enabled with `-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now`):

* Does the steps of Partial RELRO, plus:
* Causes the linker to resolve all symbols at link time (before starting execution) and then remove write permissions from `.got`.
* `.got.plt` is merged into `.got` with full RELRO, so you wonâ€™t see this section name.

Only full RELRO protects against overwriting function pointers in `.got.plt`. It works by causing the linker to immediately look up every symbol in the PLT and update the addresses, then `mprotect` the page to no longer be writable.
