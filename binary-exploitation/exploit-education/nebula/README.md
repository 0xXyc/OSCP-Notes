# Nebula

## Introduction

Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at:

* SUID files
* Permissions
* Race conditions
* Shell meta-variables
* $PATH weaknesses
* Scripting language weaknesses
* Binary compilation failures

At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.

We can authenticate to this box via SSH:

* Be sure to boot the image live and obtain the IP address first!

```
ssh level00@<ip-here>
password: level00
```
