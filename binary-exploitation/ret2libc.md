# ret2libc

## Introduction

This is primarily the attack you will use when you notice that the <mark style="color:yellow;">NX protection</mark> is <mark style="color:green;">ENABLED</mark> on the binary that you are attacking. This means that <mark style="color:yellow;">you do NOT have an executable stack to mess around with</mark>. This is because <mark style="color:yellow;">the stack memory is protected with the no execute (NX) bit enabled</mark>.

**Why does this matter to us?**&#x20;

Well, in a typical stack-based buffer overflow, an attacker will be able to write their shellcode into the vulnerable program's stack and be able to execute it on the stack.

But, <mark style="color:yellow;">if</mark> the NX bit is <mark style="color:yellow;">ENABLED</mark>, we will <mark style="color:red;">not</mark> be able to execute our shellcode from the vulnerable program's stack.

**How does ret2libc work?**

This attack allows us to bypass the NX bit protection and&#x20;
