# ðŸ’£ Binary Exploitation

## Binary Exploitation Roadmap

* Buffer Overflows (BOFs)
* return-into-libc
* Return oriented programming on x86

**ROP Emporium General Bug Hunting Advice:**

* Each binary has the same vulnerability
  * A user-provided string is copied into a stack-based buffer with no bounds checking
  * This allows a functionâ€™s saved return address to be overwritten
  * Since this overflow occurs directly on the stack, you can stick your ROP chain right there and the program will dutifully return through it
  * Focus on how you design your ROP chains

**Problems you will run into: https://ropemporium.com/guide.html**

1. Certain restrictions will be put in place; manipulating how you have to design your ROP chain to be successful
2. Dealing with bad characters
3. Limited or obscure access to a set of gadgets

Debugging Once you have planned your ROP chain, a debugger can make things much clearer and highlight any errors you have made early on. Pwntools can launch binaries via GDB and radare2 features a powerful debugger. Debugging can give you a good indication of whether your chain will work in practice.
