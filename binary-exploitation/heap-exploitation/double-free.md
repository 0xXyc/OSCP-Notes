# Double Free

## Introduction

<mark style="color:yellow;">This occurs when a pointer or address is freed twice</mark>.

This causes the program to freak out because the memory management for the program has become corrupted.

It is possible for `malloc()` to return the same pointer twice as a result (hence double free), find out what pointer gets returned by the `malloc()` call, malloc your data that was double freed or freed, and lastly your data will be called; resulting in code execution.
