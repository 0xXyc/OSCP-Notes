# Write-What-Where

## Introduction

<mark style="color:yellow;">Write whatever data you want, whenever you want, wherever you want</mark>.

#### When does this happen?

This occurs when programs fail to utilize the heap correctly or make use of `free()` properly.

## How

Info that is overwritten in the heap-portion of memory can allow an attacker to be <mark style="color:yellow;">able to overwrite a pointer and write/place whatever you want on the heap</mark>.

#### Note:

<mark style="color:yellow;">It is possible to overwrite a pointer in the Global Offset Table</mark> (<mark style="color:yellow;">GOT</mark>).

This is done by calling `malloc()` on your data and having it called by taking advantage of a dangling pointer that has not been freed with `free()`.
