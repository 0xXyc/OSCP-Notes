# üçé MacOS Security Research

## Introduction and Motivations

I have a few short/long-term goals and ideas that I want to do and I strongly believe that spending more time better equipping myself with Mac/iOS security research will make my security adventure all the more enjoyable and fruitful (pun intended).

### What Will This Page be About?

I will dedicate this space for determining if I believe that this is a route for me. Based off of my ideas alone, I **strongly** believe that this will be an incredibly difficult, humbling, journey. But, also may be my most "worth it" adventure yet. This will also greatly be centered around the Off Sec certification, the Off Sec MacOS Researcher (OSMR).

### OffSec MacOS Researcher

Not going to lie, this is so niche, that it really caught my eye. I really want this.

#### This page will consist of the following:

* Problems that I may run into
* General research to get my "head in the game"&#x20;
* Critical prerequisites
* Problems and potential shortcomings with the course itself
* and so much more
