# Viewing EXIF Data

## Exchangeable Image File (EXIF)

* There is data embedded within our image!
* We can find information such as location, date, and time the picture was taken!

You can place images in here to extract EXIF data:

{% embed url="http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi" %}

* You can find out what time a person was somewhere
* What phone or other device they used
* What date the picture was taken
* Location of where it was taken (longitude and latitude)
