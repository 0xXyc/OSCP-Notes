# Identifying Geographical Locations

This is for when you have a picture you are performing OSINT on and it does not contain any useful EXIF data.

This can be very difficult but look at the image from an analytical point of view. Be sure to look at the image from all different angles.

### Tips if you're stuck:

Put the image in reverse Google Search.

What buildings are in the image?

What is the weather?

If there is snow, odds are you are in the northern hemisphere somewhere

What do the cars look like?&#x20;

Is there writing on the buildings?

Licence plates?
