  Hackers are both people who make code as well as break it. There is elegance
  to be found and appreciated from both ends of the spectrum. The best hackers
  do both.

# ðŸŽ¨ The Art of Exploitation

## High vs Low-Level Programming Languages

## Programming

* A computer does not understand English
* It only understands <mark style="color:yellow;">machine code</mark>
  * Consisting of raw bits and bytes
  * Differs from architecture to architecture

### How do you get around writing machine code?

* Writing machine language sounds absolutely terrifying (and boring)
* The work around for this is a translator
* Also known as an <mark style="color:yellow;">assembler</mark>
* Translates <mark style="color:yellow;">assembly</mark> code into machine code
* However, assembly is still an incredibly difficult to understand and work with language as it is very low-level
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Now to get around writing assembly, you need to master a higher-level programming language as they are much more intuitive</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">High-level programming languages</mark> can be <mark style="color:yellow;">translated into machine code</mark> by using a <mark style="color:yellow;">compiler</mark>

## Pseudo-Code

* This is a form of programming language called pseudo-code
* Very similar to a high-level programming language
* It is NOT understood by computers, compilers, or assemblers of any kind
* Great way for a programmer to arrange instructions
