## Stuck?

* Did you fully enumerate what we are exposed to?
* Look for directories or anything that can be of use to us through enumeration
* Understand that wordlists will not enumerate EVERYTHING all the time
* We need to get creative at times
* What can we leverage?
* Rescan the box if we are still stuck and enumerate ports once more
