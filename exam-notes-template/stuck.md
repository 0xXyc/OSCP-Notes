# Stuck?

## Tips that helped me in the past

* Did you fully enumerate what we are exposed to?
* Look for directories or anything that can be of use to us through enumeration
* Understand that wordlists will not enumerate EVERYTHING all the time
* Understand that we need to get creative
* What can we leverage?
* Rescan the box if we are still stuck and enumerate ports once more
* Stick to the basics, did we FULLY exhaust our checklists/methodology?
* Password reuse?
* Box name hint?
