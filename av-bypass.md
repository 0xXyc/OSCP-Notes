# ðŸ˜‡ AV Bypass

There are two main methods that attackers will use in an effort to mitigate anti virus detection.

Those are **Obfuscation** and **Encryption.**

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Obfuscation</mark> distorts the malware while keeping its form
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Encryption</mark> eliminates the ability for AV to detect malware through signature alone
  * This can be done using a "crypter"
  * There are two types of crypters: **scantime** and **runtime.**

<mark style="color:yellow;">Scantime crypters are simple and very portable. This must be placed on the disk to be executed</mark>.

<mark style="color:yellow;">Runtime crypters use various injection techniques to decrypt the malicious payload and execute it in memory without ever touching the disk</mark>.

### Payload Testing

This is by far the most effective way of testing your payloads. Remember that some distributors will send the results to other AV engines (i.e. virustotal).
