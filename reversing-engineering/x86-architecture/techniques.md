  There are two basic techniques that you can utilize when analyzing malware.
  That is static and dynamic analysis.

# Techniques

### Static Analysis

Static analysis used software tools to <mark style="color:yellow;">examine the executable WITHOUT running the actual decompiled instructions in assembly</mark>.&#x20;

We will not focus on this type of analysis here as we are going to focus on actual disassembled binaries.

### Dynamic Analysis

<mark style="color:yellow;">Dynamic analysis uses disassemblers and debuggers to analyze malware binaries while actually running them</mark>.

The most popular tool is called IDA. This is a multi-platform, multi-processor disassembler and debugger.&#x20;

* A disassembler will convert an executable binary written in Assembly, C, C++, etc into Assembly language instructions that you can debug and manipulate
