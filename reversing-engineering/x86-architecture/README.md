## Goals

Malware analysis is the concept of modern malware analysis. Malware analysis is the understanding and examination of information necessary to respond to a network intrusion.

We will dive into the basic concepts of malware reverse engineering and graduate to an entry-level basic examination of Assembly Language.

What is the main secret?&#x20;

* Breaking down the malware binary and understand it, and locate it on the network in order to isolate all traces.
* It is critical to develop signatures to detect malware infections throughout your network whether it be a home-based LAN or complex corporate WAN to which malware analysis is necessary to develop host-based and network-based signatures.

### Host-based Signatures

We need to understand that these are utilized to find the malicious code in a target machine.

The malware strains have the ability to create hidden changes to a computer's registry.

### Network-based Signatures

Network signatures are used to find malicious code by examining network traffic and its patterns. It is important to note that network sniffing utilities such as Wireshark are critical here.
