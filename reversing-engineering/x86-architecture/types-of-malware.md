# Types of Malware

<mark style="color:blue;">Most malware will be written in a 32-bit architecture in order to infect as many systems as possible</mark>. This is because 32-bit programs/malware will always work on 64-bit programs so we want to understand the basics of the 32-bit world.

## Backdoor

<mark style="color:yellow;">Malicious code that embeds itself into a computer to allow a remote attacker access</mark> with very little or sometimes no authority to execute various commands on any respective local computer

## Downloader

<mark style="color:yellow;">Nothing more than malicious code that has one purpose; to install additional malicious software</mark>. Downloaders are frequently installed when a hacker gains access to a system initially. The downloader then installs additional software to control the system (usually).

## Botnet

<mark style="color:yellow;">Allows an attacker access to a system where a victim computer awaits instructions from a command-and-control (C2) server</mark> to which can control an unlimited amount of computers at the same time.

## Information-Access Malware

<mark style="color:yellow;">Gathers information from a computer and sends it directly to a host such as a keylogger or a password grabber</mark> and usually leads to obtained access to various online accounts that can be sensitive

## Loaders

<mark style="color:yellow;">Programs that launch other malicious programs which use non-standard options to get increased access</mark> or a greater cloaking/hiding technique when penetrating a system

## Rootkits

<mark style="color:yellow;">One of the most dangerous forms of malware; it hides itself and additional malware which makes it EXTREMELY hard to locate. A rootkit infects/manipulates the kernel of the OS</mark> which boots before the OS itself. This means that a user could always be connecting to a botnet or other remote computer at start up.

## Scareware

<mark style="color:yellow;">Used to trick a user into purchasing additional software that is used to falsely protect a user when there is no real threat</mark>. Once a user pays to have the tricked software removed from the computer, it then resides and later emerges if it chooses to.

## Malspam/Spam

<mark style="color:yellow;">Sends spam from a target machine which generates income for the attacker</mark> by allowing them to sell various services to other users.

## Worm

<mark style="color:yellow;">A virus that copies itself and attacks other computers through some type of vulnerability/exploit</mark> e.g. Wannacry -- MS-17-010
