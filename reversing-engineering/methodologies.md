# Methodologies

## Necessary Tasks

* Check strings&#x20;
* Check symbols
* Check for library imports if defined
* If the architecture is known, look at the memory layout and look at what registers are used for what
* Figure our how the architecture initializes the code e.g. vector table if symbols are not present
* View the spec sheets of what you are reversing if possible
* Look for unique data such as ID's, IP's, or MACs
