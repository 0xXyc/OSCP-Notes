# The Bigger Picture

Most programmers only learn the language from the top down but never manage to see the bigger picture. Hackers get their edge from knowing the bigger picture and seeing how all pieces interact with one another.

Simply realize the <mark style="color:yellow;">C code MUST be compiled</mark>. The code cannot do anything without being compiled first. <mark style="color:yellow;">It needs to be compiled into an executable binary file before it can execute</mark>.&#x20;

## First C Program

Construct Program- helloworld.c:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=0; i < 10; i++)                        // Loop 10 times
    {
        puts("Hello, world!\n");                // Place the string in the output
    }
    return 0;                                  // Tell OS the program exited without errors
}
```

* Remember, this is still just source code
* It needs to be compiled into a binary executable before it can be executed

Compile Program:

```
gcc hello_world.c
./a.out

or 

gcc hello_world.c -o hello
./hello
```
