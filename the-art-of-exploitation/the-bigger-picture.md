# The Bigger Picture

Most programmers only learn the language from the top down but never manage to see the bigger picture. Hackers get their edge from knowing the bigger picture and seeing how all pieces interact with one another.

Simply realize the <mark style="color:yellow;">C code MUST be compiled</mark>. The code cannot do anything without being compiled first. <mark style="color:yellow;">It needs to be compiled into an executable binary file before it can execute</mark>.&#x20;

## First C Program

Construct Program- helloworld.c:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=0; i < 10; i++)                        // Loop 10 times
    {
        puts("Hello, world!\n");                // Place the string in the output
    }
    return 0;                                  // Tell OS the program exited without errors
}
```

* Remember, this is still just source code
* <mark style="color:yellow;">It needs to be compiled into a binary executable before it can be executed</mark>

Compile Program:

```
gcc hello_world.c
./a.out

or 

gcc hello_world.c -o hello
./hello
```

* We just turned <mark style="color:yellow;">source code</mark> into <mark style="color:yellow;">machine code using the gcc compiler</mark>
* We went from a language us humans can understand into a language that the CPU can understand
* Remember, <mark style="color:yellow;">every CPU architecture (x86 or x64) has a different machine language</mark>

## What Does an Executable Binary Look Like?

* We can utilize GNU Development Tools in order to examine binaries
* <mark style="color:yellow;">objdump</mark>
* We can look at the <mark style="color:yellow;">machine code that the main() function was translated</mark> into

objdump:

```
objdump -D hello | gre -A20 main.:
```

* As objdump will output way too many lines, we will grep for the first 20 lines after the regular expression main.:
* You will see bytes, each byte is represented in hex

Decimal: Base10 | <mark style="color:yellow;">0-9</mark>

Hexadecimal: Base 16 | <mark style="color:yellow;">0-9 & A-F</mark>

Binary: Base 2 | <mark style="color:yellow;">0 & 1</mark>

### Memory

* The bits of the machine language instructions must be put somewhere
* These are <mark style="color:yellow;">memory addresses</mark>
* This <mark style="color:yellow;">somewhere</mark> that the instructions need to be placed <mark style="color:yellow;">is called memory</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Memory is simply a collection of bytes of temporary storage space that are numbered with addresses</mark>
