# Assembly

This is the lowest level programming language possible. It is also rather simple once you get the hang of it.&#x20;

It was originally created in the 40's to prevent computer scientists from having to manually count binary on their hands.

Keep in mind that each assembly language only works on specific chips.&#x20;

* ARM for Apple Silicon
* x86 for Intel

## Getting Started

First, you will need an assembler.

The program is divided into three sections.

1. Text section: main program code -- all of the logic
2. Block Starting Symbol section: variables
