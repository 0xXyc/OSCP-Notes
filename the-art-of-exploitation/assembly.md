# Assembly

This is the lowest level programming language possible. It is also rather simple once you get the hang of it.&#x20;

It was originally created in the 40's to prevent computer scientists from having to manually count binary on their hands.

Keep in mind that each assembly language only works on specific chips.&#x20;

* ARM for Apple Silicon
* x86 for Intel

## Getting Started

First, you will need an assembler.

{% embed url="https://www.nasm.us/" %}

Use <mark style="color:yellow;">masm</mark> if you plan on using <mark style="color:yellow;">Windows</mark>. However, for asm, I do not recommend using Windows. I feel like it is way easier to understand on a Unix platform syntactically. Unfortunately, the rest of this article is not for you if you plan on going the Windows route.&#x20;

```
sudo apt install as31 nasm

sudo apt install gdb gcc binutils
```

## VS Code Configuration

Press **CTRL + P** in VS Code and install the following:

```
ext install DamianKoper.gdb-debug

ext install maziac.asm-code-lens
```

You are now ready to begin development in asm with VS Code!

## The Program

The program is divided into three sections.

1. <mark style="color:yellow;">Text section</mark>: main program code -- all of the logic -- <mark style="color:yellow;">How do you want your program to do it?</mark>
2. <mark style="color:yellow;">Block Starting Symbol section</mark>: variables
3. <mark style="color:yellow;">Data section</mark>: contains all of the strings and other data you want to do in here. <mark style="color:yellow;">What do you want your program to do?</mark>

helloWorld.asm:

```
section .text

global  _start
_start:
    mov     edx,len   
    mov     ecx,msg   
    mov     ebx,1   
    mov     eax,4   
    int     0x80   
    mov     eax,1  
    int     0x80   
section     .data
msg     db  'Hello world!!!!!!',0xa  
len     equ $ - msg  
```

Also, the `len` has no maximum length. I tried to overflow it with a TON of A's, but since `msg` takes `len` as its length, it is all statically allocated and handles the long string. -- I think this is true. Please check me on this.

#### Compilation

```
nasm -f elf64 helloWorld.asm
```

<mark style="color:yellow;">This will generate a helloWorld.o</mark>.

#### Linking

```
ld -s -o helloWorld helloWorld.o
```

#### Execute

```
./helloWorld
Hello world!!!!!!
```
