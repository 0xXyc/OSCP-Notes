# MOSFET

## Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transmitor (MOSFET)

* A type of transistor that is an electrically driven switch and allows/prevents a flow of current
* This is all done without any mechanical moving parts

Use Cases:

* MOSFETs are an easy way of letting a low voltage system such as a Raspberry Pi control larget systems
* They are a bigger transistor which depends on how you use them
