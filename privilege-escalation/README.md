# ðŸ¤“ Privilege Escalation

## Goal: low priv -> root/administrator

This can be simple as a kernel exploit or require lots of recon on the compromised system.

Privilege escalation is essentially an example of access control violations.

### Linux Privilege Escalation Guides

The only guide I probably ever used to help me understand privilege escalation techniques in Linux systems was from g0tmi1k post.&#x20;

This blog is a must that everyone should have for preparing for the OSCP in my opinion. You can find his guide here: [https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/](https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/)

GTFOBins (I have to thank Ippsec for sharing this with me): Contains a curated list of Unix binaries that that have the ability to be exploited by an attacker to bypass local security restrictions on a Linux system. [https://gtfobins.github.io/](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
