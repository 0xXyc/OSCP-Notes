# ðŸ¦… Phoenix

## Installation

Download a Qcow2 image according to your CPU's arch:

{% embed url="http://exploit.education/downloads/" %}

Installing qemu:

```
sudo apt-get install qemu-system -y
```

Unzip Phoenix:

```
tar xJf exploit-education-phoenix-amd64-v1.0.0-alpha-3.tar\(2\).xz
```

Additional steps:

```
cd exploit-education-phoenix-amd64/
chmod +x boot-exploit-education-phoenix-amd64
./boot-exploit-education-phoenix-amd64.sh
```

We can now SSH into our QEMU binary as soon as it has finished booting:

```
ssh -p2222 user@localhost
password: user
```

## Introduction

Phoenix is the spiritual successor to the Protostar challenges. It covers the following topics:

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Network programming</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Stack overflows</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Format string vulnerabilities</mark>
* <mark style="color:yellow;">Heap overflows</mark>

> The idea is to <mark style="color:yellow;">introduce the simplest concepts first</mark>, from <mark style="color:yellow;">memory corruption</mark>, <mark style="color:yellow;">modification</mark>, <mark style="color:yellow;">function redirection</mark>, and eventually, <mark style="color:yellow;">executing shellcode</mark>. These challenges are available for both 32 bit, and 64 bit mode. The 64 bit challenges are new, and were not available on Protostar.
